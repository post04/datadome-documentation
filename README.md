# datadome-documentation
Documentation of the datadome payload and very rough example of the math stuff implemented in golang with a scuffed payload gen.

# Purpose
This is meant to be learned from, not pasted into your project. The mouse_move event generation is literally just randomness and probably wouldn't pass on scale. I also didn't collect a lot of sample payloads, there may be some obscure things in some payloads on some browsers that just weren't on mine but all and all, datadome is pretty easy to reverse engineer anyways.
